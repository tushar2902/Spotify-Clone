      <p>
        Welcome to the Spotify Clone project! This web application is a tribute
        to the world of music, designed to provide a seamless and interactive
        experience for music enthusiasts. Inspired by Spotify, this clone brings
        you a curated collection of songs, especially focusing on Favourite
        Collection and other popular tracks. Our goal is to recreate the
        familiar features you love, such as easy navigation, intuitive controls,
        and engaging playlists, while also offering a platform to explore
        independent and copyright-free music. Whether youâ€™re here to discover
        new tracks or simply enjoy your favorites, we hope to deliver a smooth
        and enjoyable listening experience. This project also serves as a
        learning platform, demonstrating front-end development skills using
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dive in, press play, and enjoy the rhythm! <br><br>
